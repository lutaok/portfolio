Hello there!<br/>
Welcome to my personal portfolio repository.
My website is currently hosted on DigitalOcean and you can find it here: [lutaok.dev](https://lutaok.dev)

It's built with [SolidStart](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start), **Typescript** and **TailwindCSS**

## TODO:

- [ ] Hobbies section
- [ ] Integration with DB
- [ ] Dark/Light theme switch and design
- [ ] Integration with Spotify API (my playlists)

## Issues

Even though I'm still actively developing and it's not polished enough, feel free to open issues about responsiveness problems, design suggestions and whatever you'd like to discuss with me. <br/>I'm open to constructive feedback and I don't mind finding new inspiration from other users.
